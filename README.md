<h1>Codsoft Internship - Machine Learning</h1>
<br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
This repository contains various machine learning projects I worked on during my internship at Codsoft. The projects include tasks such as fraud detection, customer churn prediction, and spam detection. Each project focuses on real-world data analysis and model development using Python and popular libraries.

<h3>
Projects Included </h3>
<br>
<h3>1. Fraud Detection </h3><br><p>
Developed a Random Forest Classifier for identifying fraudulent transactions.<br>
Implemented data preprocessing techniques such as feature encoding and scaling.<br>
Achieved high accuracy by optimizing model parameters and evaluating using confusion matrix and classification reports.
</p>
<br><h3>
2. Customer Churn Prediction</h3><br>
<p>
Built multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict customer churn.<br>
Compared model performance using accuracy scores and visualizations.<br>
Applied feature scaling and categorical encoding for effective model training.
</p>
<br><h3>
3. Spam Detection</h3><br><p>
Created a text classification model using TF-IDF vectorization.<br>
Trained and evaluated Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM classifiers for spam SMS detection.<br>
Presented model evaluation results using accuracy scores and classification reports.
